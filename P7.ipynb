    "# Design of an A/B Test : Free Trial Screener\n",
    "by Julien Delbove\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiment Design\n",
    "### Metric Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiment, I will use the following invariant metric:\n",
    "* Number of cookies\n",
    "* Number of clicks\n",
    "* Click-through-probability  \n",
    "\n",
    "As evaluation metrics, I choose:\n",
    "* Gross conversion\n",
    "* Retention \n",
    "* Net conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I made these decisions for the following reasons:\n",
    "* Number of cookies (Number of unique users to visit the course overview page): Since the unit of diversion is the cookies, they must be evenly distributed between the control and the experiment groups. Therefore, I will use this metric as an invariant.\n",
    "* Number of user-ids (Number of users who enroll in the free trial): This metric is not an invariant since the experiment is expected to provide warning to the user and reduce the number of enrollment from people who can't commit enough hours. \n",
    "This metric could potentially be used as an evaluation metrics because it is expected to see a difference between the experiment and the control group. However, since it is an absolute value, it is difficult to have an a-priori idea of the distribution that can be expected for this value. The use of this metric would make the experiment more difficult to analyse. Since other metrics are possible, I would not choose this one.\n",
    "* Number of clicks (Number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button):Since the experiment happen after the click on the \"Start free trial\", this metric can be used as an invariant.\n",
    "* Click-through-probility (Number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button divided by the number of unique cookies to view the course overview page): This metric is based on 2 metrics that are invariants. Therfore it is an invariant.\n",
    "* Gross conversion (Number of user-ids to complete checkout and enroll in the free trial divided by the number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button): This metric is an evaluation metric because the ratio difference between the experiment and the control group will give the impact of the warming on the people who decide to enroll in the free trial.\n",
    "* Retention (Number of user-ids to remain enroll past the 14-day boundary divided by the number of user-ids to complete checkout): This metric could also be considered as an evaluation metrics since it measures the impact of the experiment on the ratio of users remaining enrolled pas the 14-day boundary.  \n",
    "* Net conversion (Number of user-ids to remain enroll past the 14-day boundary divided by the number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button). I choose this metric as an evaluation metric since it give the impact of the experiment on the people who remain enroll past the 14-day boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The results I expect for my chosen evaluation metrics are the following:\n",
    "* Gross conversion: if the experiment works as expected, this metric should be lower for the experiment group than for the control group. Indeed, once the pop-up as been displayed to the visitor, I expect, he will enroll only if he evaluates that he could commit the requested amount of time. Therefore, less visitors should enroll in the experiment group.\n",
    "* Retention: If only warned people enroll in the 14-day trial, I expect that more of them will remain after the 14-day boundary. Therefore this metric should be higher in the experiment group than in the control group.\n",
    "* Net conversion: I expect the net conversion to remain the same or to increase between the experiment and the control group. It measures how many people remains enroll after the 14-day boundary over the number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\". In the experiment group, enrolled people have been warned, therefore there will be less enrollment but it means also that more of them should remain enrolled after the 14-day boundary. In the control group, people are not warned, therefore there will be more enrollment but it means that more of them will leave the course in-between. At the end, the final number of people remaining engaged over the number of click on the \"Start free trial\" should be the same between the experiment and the control group. The advantage for Udacity is that udacity coaches will be less solicitated by people that are in the free trial period and that might leave early because they can't commit to enough learning hours. The coachs will then have more time to help the people who commit to enough hours during the 14-days boundary and it might result that a higher number remain enrolled.\n",

However, since there is a high risk of having a decrease of the Net conversion, it also seems that the warning is a bit to hard: it prevents people that evaluate less than 5h per week to enroll whereas depending on their background, less than 5h might enough for them. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a follow up experiment I would slightly modify the warning by making the number of hour required depending on the background of the people. In addition to the number of hours committed to learning, I would add an additional question like: How many years of experience have you got in a related field (0, 1-3, 3+). For 0 years of experience in a related field, the minimum number of hours could become 7h, for 1-3 years of experience, 5 years could remains the limit. For people, with 3+ years of experience in related field (software development, mathematics, engineering,...), the minimum number of hour could be 3h.\n",

    "As for the original experience, my hypothesis is that the gross conversion will decrease since clear expectations are set depending on the background of the people (maybe a bit less than the original experiment). But since the warning is better adapted to the people background, I expect that the Net conversion will remain the same: the warning should not prevent anybody with an adequate number of hours committed to learning with regards to their experience to enroll.\n",
